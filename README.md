Mingqi Xie's Personal Website.

With the development of platforms, namely professional and private social networking platforms, I conversely get lost in the choice of self-presenting platform. For a more simplified while personalized approach to introduce myself as a researcher and practitioner for internatinal security, I buid up this personal webpage.

#Codes and Syntax

Markdown will be the main syntax applied in webpage construction. I will add more functions for possible interactions in the future, using other languages.

#Human Languages and Expression

English will be the main language in this website. I mostly use English, Chinese, Korean and French for work, research and daily conversation. Some content including publications and writings may use other languages. This is a personal website but its main purpose is an academic platform for a junior scholar like me. While I treasure the very space to express myself thus more personlized expression may be presented here.

#TO DO LIST...

I plan to develop a diary sector for this personal page. I hope to add encrypted diary book to my website.

#Acknowledgement

I would like to thank my friend Yuya Rui and Yekai Xu for their support.
